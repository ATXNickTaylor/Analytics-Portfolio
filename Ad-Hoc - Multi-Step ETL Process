-- Ad-Hoc - Multi-Step ETL Process

-- Purpose: This is a script for a multi-step ETL Process in Microsoft SQL Server.

-- Environment: Microsoft SQL Server

-- BEGIN Query

-- Step 1: Extract our data from the source tables
WITH SalesData AS (
    -- Extracting sales data
    SELECT
        SalesID,
        ProductID,
        SaleDate,
        Amount
    FROM
        SalesTable
    WHERE
        SaleDate >= '2022-01-01'
),
ProductData AS (
    
    SELECT
        ProductID,
        ProductName,
        Category
    FROM
        ProductTable
)

-- Step 2: Transform our data using JOINs and aggregations

, SalesSummary AS (
    
    SELECT
        s.SaleDate,
        p.ProductName,
        p.Category,
        SUM(s.Amount) AS TotalSales
    FROM
        SalesData s
    JOIN
        ProductData p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
    GROUP BY
        s.SaleDate, p.ProductName, p.Category
)

-- Step 3: Load the transformed data into a new model

SELECT
    SaleDate,
    ProductName,
    Category,
    TotalSales
INTO
    SalesAnalysisModel -- This is the destination model
FROM
    SalesSummary
ORDER BY
    SaleDate, TotalSales DESC
;

-- END QUERY

-- Notes:
-- The script first extracts necessary data from sales and product tables.
-- It then transforms this data by combining (joining) sales figures with product information, summing up sales amounts for each product.
-- Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a new model, 'SalesAnalysisModel'.
-- This reason approach is efficient for large datasets because it filters & aggregates data in stages, reducing processing load and improving query performance.
