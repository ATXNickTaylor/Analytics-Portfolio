-- SQL Query to Create a Combined View for a Mental Health Care Company

-- Purpose: Create a view that combines therapist details, client information, and insurance claims
-- This view will be used in dbt for further data modeling and analysis

-- Assuming the existence of three tables:
-- 1. Therapists (TherapistID, Name, Specialization, etc.)
-- 2. Clients (ClientID, TherapistID, Name, Age, etc.)
-- 3. InsuranceClaims (ClaimID, ClientID, Date, Amount, Status, etc.)

-- Error Handling: The TRY...CATCH block is used to handle any errors that occur during the execution of the view creation
BEGIN TRY

    -- Create or Replace View: MentalHealthCareData
    CREATE OR ALTER VIEW MentalHealthCareData AS

    -- Selecting relevant columns from each table and performing JOIN operations
    SELECT
        t.TherapistID,
        t.Name AS TherapistName,
        t.Specialization,
        c.ClientID,
        c.Name AS ClientName,
        c.Age AS ClientAge,
        ic.ClaimID,
        ic.Date AS ClaimDate,
        ic.Amount AS ClaimAmount,
        ic.Status AS ClaimStatus

    -- Joining Therapists table with Clients table on TherapistID
    FROM Therapists t
    INNER JOIN Clients c ON t.TherapistID = c.TherapistID

    -- Joining the above result with InsuranceClaims table on ClientID
    INNER JOIN InsuranceClaims ic ON c.ClientID = ic.ClientID;

    PRINT 'View MentalHealthCareData created successfully.';

END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Catching and displaying the error if any occurs during the view creation
    SELECT 
        ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,
        ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
END CATCH;

-- Notes:
-- The view 'MentalHealthCareData' consolidates data across therapists, clients, and insurance claims.
-- INNER JOIN ensures that only matching records (therapists with clients and corresponding insurance claims) are included.
-- This view will facilitate in-depth analysis of therapist-client interactions and insurance claim details.
-- Can be used in dbt for creating data models that analyze patterns in mental health care, therapist specialties, and insurance claim trends.

-- End of SQL Query
