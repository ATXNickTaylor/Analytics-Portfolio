-- Snowflake SQL Script for Multi-Step Data Analysis

-- Purpose: This script is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data, executed in a sequence of steps.

-- Environment: Snowflake

-- BEGIN Query

-- Step 1: Aggregate Sales Data
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempSalesData AS
SELECT
    SaleDate,
    Category,
    SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM
    SalesData
GROUP BY
    SaleDate, Category;

-- Explanation:
-- This step aggregates sales data by date and category, calculating the total sales for each combination.
-- A temporary table 'TempSalesData' is created to store these aggregated results. Temporary tables in Snowflake are session-specific, which makes them good for handling intermediate datasets in any multi-step analysis.

-- Step 2: Calculate Average Sales
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempAvgSales AS
SELECT
    SaleDate,
    AVG(TotalSales) AS AvgSales
FROM
    TempSalesData
GROUP BY
    SaleDate
ORDER BY
    SaleDate;

-- Explanation:
-- This section calculates the average sales for each date using the aggregated data from the previous step.
-- Results are stored in another temporary table 'TempAvgSales'.

-- Step 3: Identify Top Categories
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempTopCategories AS
SELECT
    Category,
    SUM(TotalSales) AS TotalCategorySales
FROM
    TempSalesData
GROUP BY
    Category
ORDER BY
    TotalCategorySales DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Explanation:
-- Here, we identify the top 10 performing categories based on total sales.

-- Step 4: Combine Insights
SELECT
    a.SaleDate,
    a.AvgSales,
    b.Category,
    b.TotalCategorySales
FROM
    TempAvgSales a
CROSS JOIN
    (SELECT Category, TotalCategorySales FROM TempTopCategories LIMIT 1) b
;

-- END QUERY

-- Explanation:
-- The final step combines insights from the average sales trends and the top-performing category.
-- A CROSS JOIN is used to pair every date's average sales with the highest performing category's sales, illustrating a comprehensive view of sales performance.
