-- Advanced SQL Query for Weather Analysis

-- Purpose: Displays the Month, Max Temperate, Min Temperature, and Average Temperature for the displayed month. Average Temp is rounded to the nearest integer.

-- Environment: Microsoft SQL Server

-- BEGIN Query
WITH max AS (
  -- This 'WITH' clause starts a Common Table Expression (CTE) named 'max'. 
  -- CTEs are like temporary tables that we create for this query to use.

  SELECT
    datepart(month,record_date) AS month_max,
    -- Extracts the month part from the 'record_date' and names it 'month_max'. 
    -- It helps in grouping temperature records by month.

    MAX(data_value) AS max_value
    -- Calculates the maximum ('MAX') temperature ('data_value') for each month.

  FROM temperature_records
  -- Specifies that we are using data from the 'temperature_records' table.

  GROUP BY datepart(month,record_date)
  -- Groups the records by month for aggregating the maximum temperatures.
),

min AS (
  -- Another CTE named 'min', similar to 'max', but for calculating minimum temperatures.

  SELECT
    datepart(month,record_date) AS month_min,
    MIN(data_value) AS min_value
  -- Calculates the minimum ('MIN') temperature for each month.

  FROM temperature_records
  GROUP BY datepart(month,record_date)
),

avg AS (
  -- A CTE named 'avg' for calculating average temperatures.

  SELECT
    datepart(month,record_date) AS month_avg,
    CAST(ROUND(AVG(CAST(data_value AS FLOAT)), 0) AS INT) AS avg_value
    -- Calculates the average ('AVG') temperature, converts it to a FLOAT for precise averaging, 
    -- rounds it to the nearest whole number, and then casts it as an INT to remove decimals.

  FROM temperature_records
  WHERE data_type LIKE 'avg'
  -- Filters records to include only those where 'data_type' indicates an average value.

  GROUP BY datepart(month,record_date), data_type
)

-- The main query begins here, using the above-defined CTEs:

SELECT
  month_max,
  max_value,
  min_value,
  avg_value
  -- Selects the month and the calculated max, min, and avg temperatures.

FROM max
-- Specifies that we are using data from the 'max' CTE.

JOIN min ON min.month_min = max.month_max
-- Joins the 'min' CTE with 'max' CTE on the month, ensuring data is matched by the same month.

JOIN avg ON avg.month_avg = max.month_max
-- Similarly, joins the 'avg' CTE with 'max', again matching by month.
;

-- END Query
