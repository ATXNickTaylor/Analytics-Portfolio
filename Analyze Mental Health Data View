-- Advanced SQL Query for Data Analysis from the MentalHealthCareData View

-- Purpose: Analyze therapist performance, client demographics, and insurance claim patterns, focusing on meaningful relationships between these entities.

-- Environment: Assumes the existence of a view named 'MentalHealthCareData' created from previous code file: ViewCreationWithErrorHandling

-- Utilizing CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for structured, modular analysis

-- BEGIN Query

-- Notes:
-- This query provides a multi-faceted analysis of the mental health care data, focusing on therapists, clients, and insurance aspects.
-- The use of CTEs structures the query for readability and modular analysis.
-- INNER JOINs ensure that the final dataset reflects meaningful relationships between therapists, their clients, and the clients' insurance claims.
-- The resulting dataset can be used for in-depth analysis and decision-making, such as identifying key areas for improvement or investment.

-- END QUERY
